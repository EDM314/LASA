# Learning Ability Self-Adaptive Algorithm (LASA)

Welcome to the LASA repository, where we explore the innovative LASA approach for predicting student performance based on behavioral data and exam scores.

## Repository Structure

```
LASA/
│
├── data/                  # Contains behavioral data of students and their corresponding exam scores.
│
├── LASA.ipynb             # Jupyter notebook detailing the LASA algorithm and its evaluation results.
│
├── initial_params.pkl     # Serialized file representing parameters initialized using agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
│
└── README.md              # This file, describing the repository's contents and usage.
```


## Data Folder

The `data` directory consists of datasets capturing the students' behavioral patterns and their exam performance. These datasets are crucial for training and testing the LASA model.

## Initial Parameters

`init_params.pkl` is a pickle file that contains the initial parameters obtained through agglomerative hierarchical clustering, which are used as a starting point for the LASA algorithm.

## LASA Notebook

`LASA.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that contains the implementation of the LASA algorithm along with the evaluation of its results. It is an interactive notebook that allows for the replication of the study's findings and further exploration of the algorithm's capabilities.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/EDM314/LASA.git


Navigate to the `LASA` directory and open the `LASA.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment to view the code and results.
